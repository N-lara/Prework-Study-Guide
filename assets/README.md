## Description

I was motivated to build this website to assist students enrolled in a bootcamp study helpful information.i built this to gather information on codint and break down the information into managable, organized sections that are easy to navigate, and read. This helps students have a central location with the information they need to study so they do not have to look over multiple web sites or documents to find the relevant information to study. In the making this project I myself learned much about the workings of coding fundamental concepts and the practical use of them.
